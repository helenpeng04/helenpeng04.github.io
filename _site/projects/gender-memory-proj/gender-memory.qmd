This project investigates whether gender stereotype threat influences memory performance in a heading-recall task. Data were collected from 35 participants across 1,400+ trials, cleaned in Excel, and analyzed in Jamovi using ANOVA. While results were not statistically significant, suggestive patterns indicated that stereotype threat may influence recall. Completed as a class project, the findings were presented as a poster at the CMU Department of Psychology undergraduate research session.
