This project investigates the prediction of flight delays at Pittsburgh International Airport using historical flight data from 2022â€“2023. A random forest classifier was trained to forecast 2024 delays, achieving 78% prediction accuracy. Completed as a class project, the findings were submitted as a written report and demonstrate the practical application of machine learning techniques to transportation data.
