I’m a senior at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Statistics with a concentration in Psychology. I’m interested in using data to address real-world challenges, especially in public health and education. Currently, I am a member of [OAK Lab](https://www.theoaklab.org/) where I'm investigating relational rule learning.\

Outside of academics, my hobbies are simple: reading and watching dramas. I love how stories can often reflect patterns in human behavior, cultural norms, and interpersonal dynamics. You can check out some of my favorite books in the Bookshelf tab.
