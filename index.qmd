### Statistics & Data Science Major | Aspiring Biostatistician

I’m a senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying statistics with a concentration in  psychology. I’m interested in biostatistics and how data can be used to make better decisions in health and medicine. With my background in psychology, I’ve also gained research experience in cognitive science through the [OAK Lab](https://www.theoaklab.org/), where I study how people learn and discover complex rules.

Outside of academics, I like recharging with books, shows, and other stories — my favorite way to unwind. You can find some of my favorite books in the bookshelf tab!
