    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaborators: Cami Streuly, Shirley Du, and Cole Kaforey\nInstructor: Abigail Noyce\nThis study examined whether gender stereotype threat influences memory performance in a heading-recall task. We collected data from 35 participants (1,400+ trials), cleaned the dataset in Excel, and analyzed it in Jamovi using ANOVA. Results were not statistically significant, but suggestive patterns emerged, indicating that stereotype threat may influence recall. Findings were presented as a poster at the CMU Department of Psychology undergraduate research session."

    "text": "Collaborators/Advisors: Julia Conti (graduate mentor) and Paulo Carvalho (PI)\nThis lab project studied how relational rule learning affects task mastery and whether prior rule-specific training or interleaved pretraining improve accuracy. Using participant data from OAK Lab, I applied multilevel modeling—learning the method as the project required—to analyze performance outcomes. Results showed that both prior training and interleaved pretraining influenced task accuracy, with effects varying by task difficulty."

    "text": "Collaborators: Anvith Thumma and Jordan Faustin\nThis project examined county-level determinants of adult obesity in the U.S. using the 2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps dataset. We performed exploratory analyses (scatter plots, correlation matrices) and fitted a Huber regression model to identify predictors of regional variation in obesity rates. Findings revealed strong associations between obesity and both physical inactivity and food access, though results are correlational rather than causal. Results were presented as a poster and report during a Q&A session with UnitedHealth Group professionals and statistics faculty."

Using historical flight data from 2022–2023, we trained a random forest classifier to forecast 2024 delays. The final model achieved 78% prediction accuracy, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning techniques to transportation data. Findings were submitted as a written report."

Beyond the powers and fight scenes, what sticks with me is how it reflects real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities. I’ve always loved how Magneto and Professor X parallel Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. That contrast in ideology makes the story hit harder. I love the series so much that I used to have a whole screenshot stash of the funniest X-Men moments, but it got lost somewhere along the way. So here’s to starting fresh and rebuilding the archive."

Participants completed multiple search trials in Gorilla, and data were cleaned and analyzed in Jamovi using ANOVA. Results suggested modest effects of incentives, but findings were not statistically significant, likely due to the limited sample size. Results were submitted as a written paper."

We screened 117 studies, extracting effect sizes from 13 peer-reviewed articles, and synthesized the data in R. Results indicated that both affirmative and non-affirmative interventions improved performance compared to no intervention, though subgroup analyses were limited by small sample sizes. Findings were written up as a research report."

    "text": "Instructor: Roberto Vargas\nThis study compared mental health outcomes for undergraduates graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic’s peak (2020) versus its decline (2021). Using a publicly available dataset, I evaluated 100+ survey responses and applied PCA, logistic regression, and bootstrap sampling in R to build and validate predictive models. Results suggested that students graduating during the pandemic’s decline reported greater psychological distress than those graduating at its peak. Findings were compiled into a research report."

My primary contribution focused on medication error incidents, producing a detailed statistical report that was shared alongside a team presentation."

I’m interested in using data to address real-world challenges, especially in public health and education. Currently, I’m part of the OAK Lab , where I investigate relational rule learning, how people learn and discover complex rules.\nOutside of academics, I spend my free time exploring stories through books, TV shows, and media that reveal how people think, connect, and navigate the world. These stories are my favorite way to recharge and reflect, and you can find a few of them under the bookshelf tab."
