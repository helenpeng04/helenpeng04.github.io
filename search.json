I’m interested in biostatistics and how data can be used to make better decisions in health and medicine. With my background in psychology, I’ve also gained research experience in cognitive science through the OAK Lab, where I study how people learn and discover complex rules.\nOutside of academics, I enjoy recharging with books, shows, and other stories. You can check out my statistics and data science projects in the Projects tab, and some of my favorite books in the Bookshelf tab!"

A random forest classifier was trained to forecast 2024 delays, achieving 78% prediction accuracy. Completed as a class project, the findings were submitted as a written report and demonstrate the practical application of machine learning techniques to transportation data."

Participants completed multiple search trials in Gorilla, and data were cleaned and analyzed in Jamovi using ANOVA. Results suggested modest effects of incentives, though findings were not statistically significant, likely due to the limited sample size. Completed as a class project, the findings were submitted as a written paper."

    "text": "Collaborator: Smrithi Krishnaswamy\nAdvisor: Rebecca Farina\nThis project analyzed developmental patterns in young children’s racial attitudes using pretest and posttest data from a classroom literacy intervention. Using the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure and a Friendship task, we applied exploratory analyses, repeated-measures ANOVA, and logistic and multinomial regression models to examine individual differences and predictors of change. Results showed task-specific predictors at baseline and no overall short-term intervention effects, though classroom diversity was associated with posttest attitudes. Results were communicated via poster, oral presentation, and written report."

Exploratory analyses, including scatter plots and correlation matrices, were conducted, and a Huber regression model was fitted to identify predictors of regional variation in obesity rates. Findings revealed strong associations between obesity and both physical inactivity and food access, though results are correlational rather than causal. The results were communicated through a poster, oral presentation, and written report, and were discussed in a Q&A session with UnitedHealth Group professionals and statistics faculty."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaborator: Abigail Lo\nAdvisors: Julia Conti (Graduate mentor) and Paulo Carvalho (PI)\nThis project investigates how learners discover relational rules, focusing on how training structure and worked examples shape strategy production. Using semantic embeddings and topic modeling, we analyzed participants’ verbal explanations across trials to track changes in abstraction and task understanding. Results showed that blocking and interleaving produced broadly similar strategic patterns, but providing examples shifted responses toward simpler, surface-level descriptions. These findings highlight how instructional supports can both guide and constrain relational reasoning. Findings were shared with the lab through a presentation."

    "text": "Advisors: Julia Conti (Graduate mentor) and Paulo Carvalho (PI)\nThis project investigates how people learn relational rules, focusing on the effects of rule complexity and training structure. Using experimental tasks and multilevel modeling, we tested whether mastery varies with task difficulty, whether prior exposure improves accuracy, and whether interleaved pre-training enhances performance. Results showed that mastery gaps emerged only on harder tasks, prior exposure had modest benefits, and interleaved training had no significant effect, highlighting the role of individual differences in rule learning. Findings were shared with the lab through a presentation."

    "text": "Collaborators: Amor Ai, Sisley Yang, Frank Janicke, Eesha Nagpal, and Camille Chandler\nInstructor: Phoebe Lam\nThis project investigates the impact of gender stereotype threat on academic performance through a meta-analysis. Out of 117 studies screened, 13 peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria, and effect sizes were synthesized using R. Results showed that both affirmative and non-affirmative interventions improved performance compared to no intervention, though subgroup analyses were limited by small sample sizes. Completed as a class project, the findings were written up in a formal IMRaD-style research paper and highlight the importance of intervention strategies in mitigating stereotype threat in educational settings."

    "text": "Collaborators: Aditi Srivastava, Sueah Kim, and Macy Liang-Jones\nThis project analyzes spatial, temporal, and demographic patterns in Long Beach animal shelter data to understand what drives intake volume and case outcomes. Using density mapping, seasonal decomposition, and categorical comparisons, we identify neighborhood clusters, reliable spring–summer intake spikes, and strong links between intake circumstances, species characteristics, and final outcomes. The results show how administrative shelter data can reveal pressure points in the system and guide more targeted, practical resource decisions."

Data were collected from 35 participants across 1,400+ trials, cleaned in Excel, and analyzed in Jamovi using ANOVA. While results were not statistically significant, suggestive patterns indicated that stereotype threat may influence recall. Completed as a class project, the findings were presented as a poster at the CMU Department of Psychology undergraduate research session."

Survey data from over 100 respondents were analyzed using principal component analysis, logistic regression, and bootstrap sampling in R. Results suggested that students graduating during the pandemic’s decline reported greater psychological distress than those graduating at its peak. Completed as a class project, the findings were written up as a research report and provide evidence of the long-term psychological impacts of disrupted educational transitions."

Beyond the powers and fight scenes, I really love how the series reflects real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities, especially through its long-standing analogy to the Civil Rights Movement, with Magneto and Professor X often read as parallels to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. That underlying commentary is what’s kept me coming back to the series. Unrelated to all of that, here are a few panels I just find funny or memorable."
