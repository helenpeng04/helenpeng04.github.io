    "text": "This project explores the effects of incentives on visual search performance. The task was developed using Gorilla, and data were analyzed in Jamovi. Findings indicate that while incentives may affect search efficiency, their overall impact on performance was modest and not statistically significant.\n\nCollaborators: Cami Streuly, Shirley Du, and Cole Kaforey"

I’m interested in using data to address real-world challenges, especially in public health and education. Currently, I am a member of OAK Lab where I’m investigating relational rule learning.\n\nOutside of academics, my hobbies are simple: reading and watching dramas. I love how stories can often reflect patterns in human behavior, cultural norms, and interpersonal dynamics. You can check out some of my favorite books in the Bookshelf tab."

Beyond the powers and fight scenes, what sticks with me is how it reflects real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities. I’ve always loved the way Magneto and Professor X parallel Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. — that contrast in ideology makes the story hit deeper. I used to have a whole screenshot stash of the funniest X-Men moments, but it got lost somewhere along the way. So here’s to starting fresh and rebuilding the archive."
