    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaborators: Cami Streuly, Shirley Du, and Cole Kaforey\nInstructor: Abigail Noyce\nThis project explored how gender stereotype threat influences memory performance through a heading-recall task. We collected data from 35 participants across 1,400+ trials, cleaned the dataset in Excel, and analyzed results in Jamovi using ANOVA. While effects were not statistically significant, likely due in part to the small sample size, we observed suggestive patterns indicating that stereotype threat may influence recall. Findings were presented at the CMU Department of Psychology undergraduate poster session."

    "text": "Collaborators/Advisors: Julia Conti (graduate mentor) and Paulo Carvalho (PI)\nThis project investigated relational rule learning, focusing on how understanding a relational rule affects mastery rates across tasks of varying difficulty, whether prior rule-specific training improves accuracy, and whether interleaved pretraining enhances performance. Using participant data provided by Julia Conti, I applied multilevel modeling for the first time, learning the technique as the project required, to analyze performance outcomes. The results highlighted patterns in how prior training and interleaved pretraining influenced task accuracy."

    "text": "Collaborators: Anvith Thumma and Jordan Faustin\nThis project examined county-level determinants of adult obesity in the U.S., focusing on physical inactivity and access to healthy food. Using the 2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps dataset, we performed exploratory analyses including scatter plots and correlation matrices, and fitted a Huber regression model to identify which predictors best explain regional variation in obesity rates. Results revealed strong associations, though the analysis is correlational, not causal. We presented our findings to UnitedHealth Group professionals and statistics faculty, including a Q&A session."

My partner and I trained a random forest classifier to forecast 2024 delays, achieving 78% prediction accuracy. The project provided hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques to real-world transportation data."

Beyond the powers and fight scenes, what sticks with me is how it reflects real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities. I’ve always loved how Magneto and Professor X parallel Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. That contrast in ideology makes the story hit harder. I love the series so much that I used to have a whole screenshot stash of the funniest X-Men moments, but it got lost somewhere along the way. So here’s to starting fresh and rebuilding the archive."

We collected data from participants completing multiple search trials in Gorilla, then cleaned and analyzed the dataset in Jamovi using ANOVA. While incentives showed some influence on efficiency, their overall impact on performance was modest and not statistically significant, likely due in part to the limited sample size."

Our team screened 117 studies and independently extracted effect sizes from 13 peer-reviewed articles. Using R, we synthesized the data to evaluate intervention effects. Results showed that both affirmative and non-affirmative interventions improved performance compared to no intervention, though subgroup analyses were limited by sample size."

    "text": "Instructor: Roberto Vargas\nThis independent project examined mental health differences between the undergraduate classes of 2020 and 2021, who graduated during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (peak vs. decline). I evaluated 100+ survey responses and applied statistical modeling (PCA, logistic regression) and bootstrap sampling techniques in R to build and validate five predictive models. Results suggested that students graduating during the pandemic’s decline experienced greater psychological distress compared to those graduating at its peak."

My primary contribution focused on medication error incidents, producing a detailed statistical report alongside the team’s presentation."

I’m interested in using data to address real-world challenges, especially in public health and education. Currently, I am a member of OAK Lab where I’m investigating relational rule learning, how people learn and discover complex rules.\nI like to spend my free time exploring stories, through books, TV shows, and media, that reveal how people think, connect, and navigate the world. If you’re curious, you can find a few of my favorites under the bookshelf tab."
