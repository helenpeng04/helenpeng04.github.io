    "section": "",
    "text": "This project conducted over two semesters investigates relational rule learning by exploring how the degree of understanding of a relational rule affects participants’ mastery rates across tasks of varying difficulty, whether prior training on a specific relational rule (rule matching) improves task accuracy, and whether interleaved pretraining—mixing different relational rules during training—enhances task performance. This project was my first experience with multilevel modeling, which I learned through hands-on lab work rather than formal coursework.\nCollaborators: Julia Conti and Paulo Carvalho"

Currently, I am a member of OAK Lab where I’m investigating relational rule learning.\n\nOutside of academics, my hobbies are simple: reading and watching dramas. I’m drawn to stories that reveal something deeper about how people think, connect, and navigate the world. If you’re curious, I’ve listed a few favorites under the Bookshelf tab."

I used to have a whole screenshot stash of the funniest X-Men moments, but it got lost somewhere along the way.
