Using the 2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps dataset, we performed exploratory analyses (scatter plots, correlation matrix) and fitted a Huber regression model to identify which predictors best explain regional variation in obesity rates. While we observed strong associations, our analysis is correlational, not causal.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cover.png){fig-align='center' width=170}\n:::\n:::\n",
