This project was my first experience with multilevel modeling, which I learned through hands-on lab work rather than formal coursework.\n\n**Collaborators**: Julia Conti and Paulo Carvalho\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cover.png){fig-align='center' width=466}\n:::\n:::\n",
