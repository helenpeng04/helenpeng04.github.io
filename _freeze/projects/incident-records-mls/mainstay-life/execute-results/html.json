We used statistical tests like Fisherâ€™s exact, time series, survival analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis. I specifically handled medication error analysis. Here you can find the presentation and my detailed report for our nonprofit partner, Mainstay Life Services, which supports individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism in residential or home settings.\n\n**Collaborators**: Emily Zhu, Sophia Mou, Alva He, Derek Gao, and Edward Brownhill\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mainstay-life_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
