Using publicly available data, I applied PCA and logistic regression models to analyze mental health outcomes. Results indicate that students who graduated during the pandemicâ€™s decline in 2021 experienced greater psychological distress compared to those graduating at its peak in 2020.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mental-health-covid_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
