Using publicly available data, I applied PCA and logistic regression models to analyze mental health outcomes. Results indicate that students who graduated during the pandemic’s decline in 2021 experienced greater psychological distress compared to those graduating at its peak in 2020.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cover.png){fig-align='center' width=496}\n:::\n:::\n",
