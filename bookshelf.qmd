### Favorite Comics

I’ve read a ton of X-Men over the years. Beyond the powers and fight scenes, what sticks with me is how it reflects real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities. I’ve always loved the way Magneto and Professor X parallel Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. — that contrast in ideology makes the story hit deeper. I used to have a whole screenshot stash of the funniest X-Men moments, but it got lost somewhere along the way. So here’s to starting fresh and rebuilding the archive.

::: {style="overflow-x: auto; white-space: nowrap; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px"}
```{r echo = FALSE}
imgs <- list.files("comics", pattern = "\\.(png|jpg)$", full.names = TRUE)

htmltools::HTML(paste(sprintf(
  '<div style="height: 200px; width: auto; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px; background: #f8f8f8; vertical-align: middle;">
     <img src="%s" style="max-height: 100%%; max-width: 100%%; display: block; margin: auto; object-fit: contain;">
   </div>', imgs), collapse = ""))

#TODO: pop up pictures how
