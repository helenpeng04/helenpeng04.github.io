### Favorite Comics

I’ve read a ton of X-Men over the years. Besides just the powers and fight scenes, I really love how it reflects real-world struggles faced by marginalized communities by being an analogy to the Civil Rights Movement, with Magneto and Professor X being a parallel Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. I love the series so much that I used to have a whole screenshot collection of some of my favorite X-Men moments, but it got lost somewhere along the way. So here’s to starting fresh and rebuilding the archive.

::: {style="overflow-x: auto; white-space: nowrap; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px"}
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(htmltools)

# Grab all the comic images from the "comics" folder
imgs <- list.files("comics", pattern = "\\.(png|jpg|jpeg)$", full.names = TRUE)

# Get GLightbox so clicking an image pops it up
glightbox_includes <- tags$head(
  tags$link(rel="stylesheet", href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/glightbox/dist/css/glightbox.min.css"),
  tags$script(src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/glightbox/dist/js/glightbox.min.js")
)

# Make the HTML for the images in a horizontal scroll
# each image is wrapped in a clickable <a> tag for the popup
# give them a little margin so they’re not squished together
img_html <- paste0(
  sprintf(
    '<a href="%s" class="glightbox" data-glightbox="title: Comic image;" style="display:inline-block; margin-right:10px;">
       <img src="%s" style="max-height:200px; object-fit:contain; display:block;">
     </a>', 
    imgs, imgs
  ),
  collapse = ""
)

# Wrap them all in a scrollable container so you can slide through horizontally
container <- HTML(sprintf(
  '<div style="overflow-x:auto; white-space:nowrap; padding:10px; border-radius:8px;">%s</div>', 
  img_html
))

# initalize GLightbox once the page is ready
# loop: true would allow arrows, but it's not working in Rmd
init_script <- HTML('<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    GLightbox({ selector: ".glightbox", loop: true });
  });
</script>')

# Put it all together so it actually shows up
# browsable makes the HTML render in the output properly
browsable(tagList(
  glightbox_includes,  # include GLightbox CSS/JS
  container,           # the scrollable gallery of images
  init_script          # make the popup actually work
))

```
