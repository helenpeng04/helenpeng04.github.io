This project analyzed medical incident records for Mainstay Life Services, a nonprofit supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism in residential and home settings. Our team examined patterns in incident types, needs levels, and time-to-report using Fisher’s exact tests, time series modeling, survival analysis, and Kruskal–Wallis tests. My primary contribution focused on medication error incidents, producing a detailed statistical report alongside the team’s presentation.
