This project investigates patterns in medical incident records at Mainstay Life Services, a nonprofit supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism. We analyzed incident types, needs levels, and time-to-report using Fisher’s exact tests, time-series modeling, survival analysis, and Kruskal–Wallis tests. My primary contribution focused on medication error incidents, culminating in a detailed statistical report and a team presentation. The findings highlight trends in incident reporting and provide actionable insights for improving care quality.
