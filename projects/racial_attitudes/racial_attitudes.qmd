This project analyzed developmental patterns in young children’s racial attitudes using pretest and posttest data from a classroom literacy intervention. Using the Preschool Racial Attitude Measure and a Friendship task, we applied exploratory analyses, repeated-measures ANOVA, and logistic and multinomial regression models to examine individual differences and predictors of change. Results showed task-specific predictors at baseline and no overall short-term intervention effects, though classroom diversity was associated with posttest attitudes. Results were communicated via poster, oral presentation, and written report.
