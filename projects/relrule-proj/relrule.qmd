**Collaborators/Advisors:** Julia Conti (graduate mentor) and Paulo Carvalho (PI)

This project investigated relational rule learning, focusing on how understanding a relational rule affects mastery rates across tasks of varying difficulty, whether prior rule-specific training improves accuracy, and whether interleaved pretraining enhances performance. Using participant data provided by Julia Conti, I applied multilevel modeling for the first time, learning the technique as the project required, to analyze performance outcomes. The results highlighted patterns in how prior training and interleaved pretraining influenced task accuracy.
