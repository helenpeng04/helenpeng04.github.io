This lab project studied how relational rule learning affects task mastery and whether prior rule-specific training or interleaved pretraining improve accuracy. Using participant data from OAK Lab, I applied multilevel modeling—learning the method as the project required—to analyze performance outcomes. Results showed that both prior training and interleaved pretraining influenced task accuracy, with effects varying by task difficulty.
