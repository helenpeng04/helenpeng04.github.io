This project investigates how people learn relational rules, focusing on the effects of rule complexity and training structure. Using experimental tasks and multilevel modeling, we tested whether mastery varies with task difficulty, whether prior exposure improves accuracy, and whether interleaved pre-training enhances performance. Results showed that mastery gaps emerged only on harder tasks, prior exposure had modest benefits, and interleaved training had no significant effect, highlighting the role of individual differences in rule learning.
