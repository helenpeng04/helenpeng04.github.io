This project investigates county-level determinants of adult obesity in the U.S., focusing on physical inactivity and access to healthy food. Using the 2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps dataset, we performed exploratory analyses (scatter plots, correlation matrix) and fitted a Huber regression model to identify which predictors best explain regional variation in obesity rates. While we observed strong associations, our analysis is correlational, not causal.
