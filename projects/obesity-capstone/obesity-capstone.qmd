This project examined county-level determinants of adult obesity in the U.S., focusing on physical inactivity and access to healthy food. Using the 2025 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps dataset, we performed exploratory analyses including scatter plots and correlation matrices, and fitted a Huber regression model to identify which predictors best explain regional variation in obesity rates. Results revealed strong associations, though the analysis is correlational, not causal. We presented our findings to UnitedHealth Group professionals and statistics faculty, including a Q&A session.
