This project examined whether incentives improve visual search efficiency. We collected data from participants completing multiple search trials in Gorilla, then cleaned and analyzed the dataset in Jamovi using ANOVA. While incentives showed some influence on efficiency, their overall impact on performance was modest and not statistically significant, likely due in part to the limited sample size.\
