This project investigates how graduating during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (peak vs. decline) affects depression and hope levels among students. Using publicly available data, I applied PCA and logistic regression models to analyze mental health outcomes. Results indicate that students who graduated during the pandemicâ€™s decline in 2021 experienced greater psychological distress compared to those graduating at its peak in 2020.
