**Instructor:** Roberto Vargas

This independent project examined mental health differences between the undergraduate classes of 2020 and 2021, who graduated during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (peak vs. decline). I evaluated 100+ survey responses and applied statistical modeling (PCA, logistic regression) and bootstrap sampling techniques in R to build and validate five predictive models. Results suggested that students graduating during the pandemicâ€™s decline experienced greater psychological distress compared to those graduating at its peak.
