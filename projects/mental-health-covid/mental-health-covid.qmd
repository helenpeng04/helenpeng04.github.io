This study compared mental health outcomes for undergraduates graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic’s peak (2020) versus its decline (2021). Using a publicly available dataset, I evaluated 100+ survey responses and applied PCA, logistic regression, and bootstrap sampling in R to build and validate predictive models. Results suggested that students graduating during the pandemic’s decline reported greater psychological distress than those graduating at its peak. Findings were compiled into a research report.
