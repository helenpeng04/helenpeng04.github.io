This project investigates the impact of gender stereotype threat on academic performance through a meta-analysis. Out of 117 studies screened, 13 peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria, and effect sizes were synthesized using R. Results showed that both affirmative and non-affirmative interventions improved performance compared to no intervention, though subgroup analyses were limited by small sample sizes. Completed as a class project, the findings were written up in a formal IMRaD-style research paper and highlight the importance of intervention strategies in mitigating stereotype threat in educational settings.
