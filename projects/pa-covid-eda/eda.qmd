This project analyzed COVID-19 cases and deaths across Pennsylvania counties from April 2020 to December 2022. Our team examined how population size relates to per-capita case and death rates and whether higher case counts correspond to higher deaths. Using exploratory data analysis methods and k-means clustering, we identified county-level patterns and trends across the state.
