This project analyzes COVID-19 cases and deaths across Pennsylvania counties (Apr 2020â€“Dec 2022). We explored how population size relates to per-capita rates and whether more cases lead to more deaths, using EDA methods and k-means clustering to identify county-level patterns.

**Collaborators**: Lily Fransen and Maximus Liu
