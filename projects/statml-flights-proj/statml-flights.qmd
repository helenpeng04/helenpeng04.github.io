This class project developed machine learning models to predict flight delays at Pittsburgh International Airport. Using historical flight data from 2022â€“2023, we trained a random forest classifier to forecast 2024 delays. The final model achieved 78% prediction accuracy, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning techniques to transportation data. Findings were submitted as a written report.
