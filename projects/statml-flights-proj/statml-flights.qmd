This project predicted flight delays at Pittsburgh International Airport using historical data from 2022 and 2023. My partner and I trained a random forest classifier to forecast 2024 delays, achieving 78% prediction accuracy. The project provided hands-on experience applying machine learning techniques to real-world transportation data.
