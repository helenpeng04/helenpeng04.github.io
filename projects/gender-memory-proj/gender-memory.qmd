This study examined whether gender stereotype threat influences memory performance in a heading-recall task. We collected data from 35 participants (1,400+ trials), cleaned the dataset in Excel, and analyzed it in Jamovi using ANOVA. Results were not statistically significant, but suggestive patterns emerged, indicating that stereotype threat may influence recall. Findings were presented as a poster at the CMU Department of Psychology undergraduate research session.
