This project explored how gender stereotype threat influences memory performance through a heading-recall task. We collected data from 35 participants across 1,400+ trials, cleaned the dataset in Excel, and analyzed results in Jamovi using ANOVA. While effects were not statistically significant, likely due in part to the small sample size, we observed suggestive patterns indicating that stereotype threat may influence recall. Findings were presented at the CMU Department of Psychology undergraduate poster session.
