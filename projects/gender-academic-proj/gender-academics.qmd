This project investigated the impact of gender stereotype threats on academic performance through a meta-analysis. We screened 117 studies, extracting effect sizes from 13 peer-reviewed articles, and synthesized the data in R. Results indicated that both affirmative and non-affirmative interventions improved performance compared to no intervention, though subgroup analyses were limited by small sample sizes. Findings were written up as a research report.
