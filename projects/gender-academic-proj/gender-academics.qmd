This project investigated how gender stereotype threats affect academic outcomes through a meta-analysis. Our team screened 117 studies and independently extracted effect sizes from 13 peer-reviewed articles. Using R, we synthesized the data to evaluate intervention effects. Results showed that both affirmative and non-affirmative interventions improved performance compared to no intervention, though subgroup analyses were limited by sample size.
